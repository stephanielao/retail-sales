Analyzing the effect of holidays on retail sales in 2010

This holiday season we may not see shoppers packing malls looking to spread joy as we now still face many concerns over spreading CoronaVirus. However, as we hope consumer behavior will return to old habits in the future, we took a look back in time to analyze consumer behaviors when it comes to retail spending. 
 
When exploring retail data, the challenge of making decisions based on limited history arises. Major holidays and other known events only come around once a year. This can make deducing strategic plans for those events difficult. This is why comparing data results is useful in analyzing retail data. In this project we explore how holidays affect weekly sales, by looking in depth at a few popular holidays.

We analyzed the effect of holidays and non-holidays as a whole on weekly sales as well as how stores,departments, and types differed in regards to weekly sales during holidays and non-holidays. We then decided to delve deeper and take a zoomed in look at four major holidays: the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.

In conclusion, we saw some variations in weekly sales based on departments and stores. Moreover, we saw that type C had the smallest difference between weekly sales during holidays and non holidays while types A and B had bigger differences. Overall we found that holidays do have an effect on retail sales for most stores and departments. However, for some stores and departments, that effect was less noticeable. The winter holidays of Thanksgiving and Christmas had the largest impact on weekly sales. We saw that unemployment, CPI, fuel price, and temperature had little effect on weekly sales based on whether or not it was a holiday. 

This analysis was completed solely using the 2010 sales data. This analysis is a snapshot in time and could be improved in the future by expanding our data to include more sales information spanning a larger range of dates. Avenues for further research also include figuring out which department number corresponds to which department type and figuring out the exact location of the store numbers to give us more insight.
